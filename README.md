Rendering_Demos
===============

Quick rendering demos of some shader effects that I like.  Currently there is Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, an attempt at subsurface scattering (using two depth buffers, one drawn with back faces culled and the other with front culled), and a Borderlands-style toon shader.
